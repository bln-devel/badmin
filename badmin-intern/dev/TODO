application specific "errors/*.php" -> is that views? can we use header_v.php and footer_v.php?
	-> seems to be difficult (not expected behavior)

Documentation as a LaTeX or openoffice document with style and template (think about automatic build through ANT)

implements authentication
	-> badmin is "just" an authentication entry point + plugin manager and displayer
	



refactor git (try to keep current history), find a way to insert this overall repository into eclipse/egit in order
to minimize the console commands to run
delete opatry acount on egit, use a badmin one. repository contains __CI_SYSTEM__, badmin, badmin-intern and
modules when the packaging behavior will appear
++-> doc HOWTO git (+eGit) + ssh + gitHub


mootools (version + modules etc.)


Class Module extends Controller -> set $data as tool.name, tool.*, module.name, ... + helper "pageTitle" or data[".."]
define what is exactly a module
	-> version, name, description, "dir" (root of views/models/controllers hierarchies), author, ...
	-> use config files to do that (+ think to helper tool.*)
	-> config/core/config.php, config/gallery/config.php ===> possible?
is there a meta module idea? or plugin of module?
